1. Clone : git clone <repo url in ssh>		--> generally one time task
2. Pull : git pull			--> since multiple users work, its always good to pull before making changes
3. Make changes : add, remove, modify files
4. Stage : git add .			(whatever new is added)
5. Commit : git commit -m "message"			--> This will only save to local repo
6. Push : git push    --> This is similar to git push origin main  : where origin means the current location from where we are pushing, and target is default branch name which is 'main'.
Push will actually push it to main branch to reflect there
